        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            The Eminence in Shadow follows Cid Kagenou, a young man who has been reincarnated into a fantasy world. In his 
            past life, he was just an ordinary person, but in this new life, he adopts the persona of "Shadow" and dreams of 
            becoming a mastermind. His goal is to secretly lead an organization that fights against an evil cult, even though 
            he believes the cult is purely fictional.

Cid forms a group called Shadow Garden to take down the cult, thinking he’s just playing a role. However, the enemies he believes to be imaginary turn out to be very real. What begins as a simple game soon blurs the lines between delusion and reality as his group gains influence and power in the world.

            As the story progresses, Cid’s followers, unaware of his true motives, unknowingly carry out his plans. They 
            become entangled in a dangerous battle against the cult, unaware that the threats they face are far greater
            than Cid could have ever imagined. His influence spreads as his actions have more consequences than he realizes.

Throughout the series, Cid gradually uncovers the true extent of the cult's power. However, his delusions persist, and he continues to think everything is part of his grand plan. The Eminence in Shadow is an exciting blend of action, comedy, and mystery, with a protagonist who remains unaware of his growing importance.
