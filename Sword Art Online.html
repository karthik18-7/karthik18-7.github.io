        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            In the near future, virtual reality gaming reaches new heights with the release of Sword Art Online (SAO). 
            Players use advanced VR headsets to fully immerse themselves in a virtual world. However, the game's creator 
            traps them inside, declaring that they can only escape by clearing all 100 levels of the game. If a player dies in the 
            game, they die in real life, raising the stakes for survival.

Kirito, a skilled solo player, becomes one of the first to realize the danger of their situation. He quickly joins forces with other players, including Asuna, a strong and determined warrior. Together, they face fierce battles and dangerous bosses, building trust and friendship along the way. As they progress through the game, their bond grows, making them an unstoppable force in the fight for survival.

            As the game progresses, Kirito and Asuna uncover dark secrets about the game's true purpose and the intentions 
            of its creator. They face not only the challenge of clearing the game but also the psychological toll of being 
            trapped in an alternate reality. Despite these pressures, they refuse to give up, determined to see the game’s 
            final level completed.

Sword Art Online explores themes of love, friendship, and survival in a high-stakes, digital world. With breathtaking action sequences and emotional depth, the series shows how relationships evolve under extreme circumstances. The story has become a defining tale of virtual reality, raising questions about technology and human connection.
